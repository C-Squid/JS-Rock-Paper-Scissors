# JS-Rock-Paper-Scissors
JavaScript fxn practice

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors)

This is the WebDev101 version. 
I have not yet learned:
  - for loops,
  - separate style sheets
  - console styling
  - any other of the neat things I saw in other student submissions.

More to come, it seems.

I learned it as Paper Rock Scissors but I'm flexible.
