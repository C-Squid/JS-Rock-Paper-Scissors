# JS-Rock-Paper-Scissors
JavaScript fxn practice

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors)

I learned it as Paper Rock Scissors but I'm flexible.

buttons.html includes DOM manipulation and Events. At this point I could not create a loop which allowed the game to be
played a specified number of times. Instead there is a counter which recognizes when 5 individual games
have been played.

This feels highly inefficients.
